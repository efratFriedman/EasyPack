**Easypack**



**ðŸ§³ What is Easypack?**

**Easypack** is a smart packing assistant built to help users pack efficiently when moving apartments. It uses a powerful algorithm and image analysis to optimize how belongings should be packed into boxes â€” reducing stress and saving time.

**ðŸš€ Features**

**âœ… Smart Room Analysis** â€“ Upload a room image and let the system detect, measure, and categorize items.

**âœ… Bin Packing Algorithm**â€“ Calculates the minimum number of boxes needed based on object volume.

**âœ… PDF Export** â€“ Users receive a detailed box-packing list they can export to PDF.

**âœ… Authentication with Validation** â€“ Full login/signup process with robust field validation.

**Image is sent to a Python-based object detection server.**

**The image is analyzed**

**Items are detected, their dimensions are estimated, and tagged
Object volume data is processed with a Bin Packing Algorithm to determine the optimal number of boxes.
